# Neural Network in Matlab
The purpose of this work is to classify the hand written digits with high accuracy
<br/>
There are two methods used here. Multiclass Classification and Neural Network 
<br/>
The accuracy of multiclass classification -ex3.m runs-
<br/>
Training Set Accuracy: 94.880000
<br/>
The accuracy of neural network -ex3_nn.m runs-
<br/>
Training Set Accuracy: 97.520000
<br/>
As it is seen, neural network gives better results
